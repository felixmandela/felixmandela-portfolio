## 🌟 **Portfolio Highlights** 🌟

Delve into some of my projects showcasing my coding skills and creativity:

1. [🍅 Pomify](https://pomify.vercel.app/): Pomify is a pomodoro timer application with a twist - Spotify integration! It was my maiden venture into REST APIs. Using Spotify's API, I built a backend server with Node.js and Express, enabling users to work and break to their favorite music tracks. It was a great project to demonstrate my proficiency in SCSS, JavaScript, and managing third-party APIs.

2. [⌚ Rolex Showcase](https://rolex-showcase.vercel.app/): This project is a testament to my eye for detail and aesthetic design. I designed a simple yet elegant landing page to showcase Rolex watches. An added element of interactivity was the infinite loop effect for the list of watches, creating a captivating user experience.

3. [🐍 Retro Snake Game](https://oldskool-snake.vercel.app/): Retro Snake Game was a nostalgic journey for me. As my first portfolio project, I leveraged JavaScript to recreate the classic snake game with modern twists. The game features animations and customizable settings, highlighting my skills in JavaScript and creative problem-solving.
